# 📊 Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a **data analysis project**, developed in Python and organized in a Jupyter Notebook. The main goal is to explore, clean, and analyze data to extract meaningful insights through statistical and visual analysis.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── AnalíseFinal.ipynb   # Main notebook containing the full analysis
├── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## 🧠 Project Objective

* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Analyze distributions, patterns, and correlations
* Create visualizations to support interpretation
* Support data-driven decision making

> This project can be used as a study case, portfolio project, or as a foundation for more advanced analyses.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical computing
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** (if applicable) – preprocessing or modeling

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash

   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\\Scripts\\activate     # Windows
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
   ```

5. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

6. Run the **AnalíseFinal.ipynb** notebook.

## 📈 Expected Results
